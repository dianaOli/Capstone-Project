Three Capstone Ideas

Project Idea 1: Trick-or-Treating Neighborhood App
Description:
This app will track houses that are giving out candy during Halloween, helping trick-or-treaters plan their routes efficiently.
 It will feature an interactive map where users can mark and search for houses that are participating, making the Halloween experience more organized and fun. 
Users can also filter houses by features such as "candy types," "house decorations," or "special events" like haunted houses.

Data:
The app will collect data from users who can mark houses on the map and submit additional information like candy availability or decorations. 
The app could also use external APIs like Google Maps for route optimization and location services to track nearby houses.

Project Idea 2: Spooky Game – Bone Collector in the Cemetery
Description:
A spooky game where the player needs to gather bones scattered across a haunted cemetery to escape before time runs out.
 The game will feature eerie graphics, sound effects, and puzzles that players must solve to uncover bones hidden in secret locations. 
The goal is to gather all the bones and unlock the exit gate to escape the cemetery, avoiding traps and supernatural entities along the way.

Data:
This game will primarily rely on game logic, with static data for bone locations, puzzles, and obstacles. It could also include external APIs for randomizing puzzles or creating dynamic challenges. 
The game would use local storage to save player progress and achievements.

Project Idea 3: Ice Cream Truck Request App
Description:
An app where users can request ice cream trucks to come to their location. 
Customers can select the ice cream truck nearest to them, choose their favorite ice creams, and track the truck as it heads their way.
 The app will feature real-time GPS tracking, order customization, and payment integration, making it easy for ice cream lovers to get their treats delivered directly to them.

Data:
This app would use real-time GPS tracking data, possibly integrating with Google Maps API to show truck locations and user destinations. 
User preferences, order history, and payment data would also need to be managed, likely through an internal API for user authentication, payment processing, and order tracking.

My Preferred Project Idea:
Spooky Game – Bone Collector in the Cemetery
Out of the three ideas, I am most excited to work on the spooky game. It combines my love for interactive experiences with a touch of mystery and thrill. 
I look forward to creating engaging puzzles, eerie game environments, and a fun yet challenging storyline.
